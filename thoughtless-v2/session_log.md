**Session Log - 2025-08-20**

*   **Objective:** Debug and fix the Gemini OAuth flow.
*   **Initial State:** The user was getting a `5 NOT_FOUND` error when trying to connect to Gemini.
*   **Debugging Steps:**
    1.  Identified that the API key was hardcoded in the frontend and fixed it by using environment variables.
    2.  Invalidated the old API key and created a new one.
    3.  Fixed the Firebase Hosting rewrite rules to correctly route API requests.
    4.  Moved the `cors` middleware to the correct place in the Express app.
    5.  Added logging to the backend to trace the OAuth callback.
*   **Current Issue:** The `5 NOT_FOUND` error persists.
*   **Next Step:** We have identified that the nested project structure is a likely cause of the problem. We have moved the project to a new, clean directory (`/home/thoughtless2025/thoughtless-v2-clean`) and will restart the chat session from that new directory to continue debugging.
